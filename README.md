# RobotOrders

## Introduction 

This RobotOrders project was one of the things I worked on during college and I had to implement a Linked List that contained restaurant orders delivered by robots. These orders contained the robot that delivered the food, restaurant, the address for food delivery, and the food for the the order. The program would print out all of the restaurant orders at the end of the program.

## Technologies

## What I've learned

While making the LinkedList I improved my C syntax, Data structure understanding, and my dynamic memory allocation skills.
